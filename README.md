# DEDiscover

DEDiscover is a very small scientific workbench based of the software on the same name that was developed at the 
University of Rochester between 2006 and 2014, and for which it seems that no trace remains. 
It is a GUI application that runs on the desktop. It is meant to allow non-mathematicians and non-programmers to easily create
and analyze models based on differential equations.

This project implement a subset of 
the functionality of the original software. It uses some of the original code but also went through a lot a rewrite and redesign.

It currently run only on Linux, and for some very specific version of java8 and gcc.

This is an alpha version. It will work most of the time, but also crash more than it should.

More details and documentation, as well as detailed installation and building information, can be found at the [dediscover website](https://dediscover.org).
